    "content": "The Department of Energy Science and Engineering (DESE) focuses on research and education for the development of sustainable energy systems for the future. The Department is an unique blend of science and engineering for the Energy sector. DESE is a leading interÂ­disciplinary energy education and research hub. <p> DESE has developed several novel education programs focusing on the application of science and engineering to problems in energy. The Department currently has 25 core faculty members and more than 400 students (including 150 PhD students) and several associated faculty from other departments. Recent highlights in research and development include a grid connected MW scale solar thermal power plant and test facility, self cleaning solar PV modules, high efficiency PV cells based on new materials, novel Li-ion batteries, improved flow fields for Fuel Cells, and biofuel based rural electrification. DESE has cutting edge fabrication, characterisation, testing and demonstration facilities with strong industrial linkages and international collaborations. We welcome you to partner with us to help design and build sustainable energy systems For the Future.</p>"
